For this assignment, I created unit tests using the pytest framework for each of the main functionalities 
specified in the requirements_specification.md document. The tests follow the structure and style of the 
provided sample_test.py, with a separate test script for each function (R1 through R7). Each script includes 
both positive and negative test cases, covering the essential behaviors expected from the system.

In R1, I tested key input validations for the book catalog form, including empty fields, max character 
limits, digit-only ISBN constraints, and proper handling of copy counts. For R3, I verified valid borrowing behavior, 
patron ID validation, enforcement of the 5-book limit, and rejection of unavailable or invalid book IDs. 
R4 includes tests for invalid returns, duplicate return attempts, and message correctness; while the backend 
logic may not yet be fully implemented, the test cases are structured to validate the expected behavior once it is. 
For R5, I tested the late fee logic including small/large overdue ranges, non-negative amounts, and the $15.00 cap. 
R6 covers case-insensitive partial matches for titles/authors and exact ISBN matching, along with invalid search 
types and empty queries which are some of the key behaviours. Finally, R7 validates that the patron status report 
includes all required fields and types, handles invalid patrons gracefully, and aligns with the output structure specified.

I did not write unit tests for R2 because it is primarily a UI-rendered feature and there was no backend
function available for retrieving catalog data in a testable form. While I did not test every possible edge 
case since we only need 4–5 test case for each, I ensured that the key behaviors described in the requirements
were thoroughly tested for each function. Overall, the test suite provides coverage for all core functionalities 
expected in the system.
